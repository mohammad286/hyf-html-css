      <p> I have lived in the Netherlands for about 3 years now. I have
learned to speak Dutch at level b1. I would very much like to do
something suitable taking into account my abilities and the
needs on the labor market. I find programming and web
development beautiful. I think I will be good at it and is
important for the labor market.</p>
    
    
    <p> I have been interested in the computer since I was young.
My first step was that I began to learn about software and how
to deal with programs, windows and the problems that users of
computer can face with for instance downloading software ,
formatting or installing windows. I also learned to solve
problems that occur when someone tries to download a
program which has a difficult crack, and to break passwords for
windows, and to replace computer parts . I worked in a
computer repair shop briefly until I emigrated from Syria.</p>

    
    
    <p>I completed a Photoshop course successfully and I have learned
to work with Corel draw a little bit. Furthermore I have done a
web design course. At that time we used a front page program.
I began to pay attention to the content of programs and how to
      give orders in programs.</P> </div>
