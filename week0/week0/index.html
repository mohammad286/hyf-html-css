  <p>William Shakespeare (baptized on April 26, 1564 to April 23, 1616) <br>was an <strong> English playwright </strong>, actor and poet also known as the <br>“Bard of Avon” and often called England’s national poet. <br>Born in Stratford-upon-Avon, England, he was an important member<br> of the Lord Chamberlain’s Men company of theatrical players from <br>roughly 1594 onward. Written records give little indication of the <br>way in which Shakespeare’s professional life molded his artistry.<br> All that can be deduced is that, in his 20 years as a playwright, <br>Shakespeare wrote plays that capture the complete range of human<br> emotion and conflict .</p>
  
  <h2 id="born" class="important">When and Where Was William Shakespeare Born?</h2>
  
  <p class="add">Though no birth records exist, church records indicate that a William Shakespeare was,<br> baptized at Holy Trinity Church in <strong>Stratford-upon-Avon on April 26, 1564</strong>. From this,<br> it is believed he was born on or near April 23, 1564, and this is the date scholars acknowledge as William Shakespeare's birthday.<br> Located 103 miles west of London, during Shakespeare's time Stratford-upon-Avon was<br> a market town bisected with a country, road and the River Avon.<br>William was the third child of John Shakespeare, a leather merchant, and Mary Arden,<br> a local landed heiress. William had two older sisters, Joan and Judith, and three younger brothers, Gilbert, Richard and Edmund. Before William's birth, his father became a successful merchant and held official positions as alderman and bailiff, an office resembling a mayor. However, records indicate John's fortunes declined sometime in the late 1570s.<br>Scant records exist of William's childhood, and virtually none regarding his education. Scholars have surmised that he most likely attended the King's <br>New School, in Stratford, which taught reading, writing and the classics. Being a public official's child, William would have undoubtedly qualified for free tuition. But this uncertainty regarding his education has led some to raise questions about the authorship of his work and even about whether or not William Shakespeare ever existed.<br></p>
